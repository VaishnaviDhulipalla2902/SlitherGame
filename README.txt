The game utilizes pygame module.
The position of apple is randomized.
The gameloop has implementations of functions-snake,randapple.
Snake function displays a list of elements which is basically the body of the snake,length of body is incremented by appending elements to it if the head or the last element of list ==position of apple.
The snake can be controlled  by arrow keys.
If the element of list other than head matches the head co-ordinates which is if the snake touches itself,the game is over.
The score is increased if head co-ordinates match the co-ordinates of apple which is randomly generated and after this is done the apple is generated elsewhere.
